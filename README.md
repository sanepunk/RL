# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms. The goal is to provide clean, educational implementations of RL algorithms using modern deep learning frameworks.

## Structure

- `Reinforce/` - Contains REINFORCE algorithm implementation
  - Implementation uses JAX/Flax for the CartPole environment

## Getting Started

Each algorithm directory contains its own README with specific implementation details and usage instructions.

## Dependencies

The implementations primarily use:
- JAX for high-performance computing
- Flax (Neural Networks library for JAX)
- Gymnax for RL environments
- Optax for optimization

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute additional RL algorithm implementations or improvements to existing ones.
